          As Design Lead for <strong>Fidelity</strong>, I led key
          initiatives like <strong>Fidelity Wealth Central</strong> for Advisors
          and <strong>My Prime</strong> for hedge fund managers. My role peaked
          with a major Web Refresh for Wealth Central, enhancing its design and
          user experience.

          markedly improved its design and usability.

          For My Prime, another significant project, I immersed myself in the
          user environment by joining traders on the capital markets floor. This
          hands-on research was pivotal in developing an MVP that stands as a
          benchmark for next-generation progressive web applications.

          In our initial research and discovery, we delved into the traders'
          pain points with the help of third-party analysts and consultants,
          gaining a nuanced understanding. This knowledge, coupled with new
          technologies, has been instrumental in enhancing performance and
          refining the user interface to address their needs effectively with
          each successive update.

          Our deliverables included a functional prototype, informed by insights
          into traders' challenges and bolstered by new technology. This
          prototype has become a crucial tool for testing and refining the user
          experience, leading to tangible improvements in their daily
          performance.
