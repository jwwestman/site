          At Aetna Behavioral Health, I spearheaded transformative initiatives:

          accessibility for members and integrating fitness merchandise into our
          rewards program, both aimed at enhancing the behavioral health user
          journey and setting a benchmark for future innovation.

          A key accomplishment was the revamp of the user journey, introducing a
          novel entry point that made the checkout process smoother and
          inherently intuitive. But this wasn't just about the immediate; I also
          laid the foundation for a broader merchandise assortment slated for
          2023, always keeping an ear to the ground for user feedback and
          emerging market trends.<br /><br />

          This project's breadth went beyond mere aesthetics, delving into both
          front-end user interactions and backend functionalities to ensure a
          harmonized and enriching shopping experience in the rewards arena.
